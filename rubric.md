# Rubric

The following is the rubric for this project. To get a full score, you must meet the **Proficient** standard for all of the criteria.

## Criteria

### Correctness

- **Exemplary:** All functions are complete with all tests passing.

- **Proficient:** No more than one function has failing tests.

- **Developing:** No more than two functions have failing tests.

- **Novice:** More than two functions have failing tests.

### Reusability

- **Exemplary:** No functions have hardcoded conditionals or values, and are adaptive to different kinds of data. Functions do not make use of global variables at all. Edge-cases are handled thoughtfully, reminiscent of production-level code. (e.g. early returns, lack of repetitive lines of code.)

- **Proficient:** No functions have hardcoded conditionals or values, and are adaptive to different kinds of data. Functions do not make use of global variables at all.

- **Developing:** The overwhelming majority of functions do not have hardcoded conditionals or values, and are adaptive to different kinds of data.

- **Novice:** Functions rely on global variables or are very reliant on specific data being present to work.

### Clarity

- **Exemplary:** All functions use thoughtful and descriptive variables, wherever possible. Comments are used to help explain the thought process behind certain functions and processes.

- **Proficient:** All functions use thoughtful and descriptive variables, wherever possible. Alternatively, comments are used to help explain the thought process behind certain functions and processes.

- **Developing:** Functions make use of named variables but there is some lack of clarity in the names. For example, single-letter, abbreviated, or meaningless (e.g. `thing`, `data`) variables are used often.

- **Novice:** Functions lack clarity and rely heavily on code that is difficult to parse.
